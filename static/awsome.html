  <h3>TL;DR: You can squat S3 bucket names.</h3>
  Everyone and their uncle has a branded vulnerability website, why not me?

  <p>S3 buckets are unique across AWS. Try creating a bucket named "apple.com", you can't because I have already made it.

  To host a static website on S3 like this, you need to name your bucket after the website. The bucket hosting this website is <i>awsome.pw</i> and there's <i>www.awsome.pw</i> to redirect <i>www</i>.</p>

  <p>If I know the name of your awesome website, I can create the bucket to prevent you from hosting it on AWS.</p>

  <h4>This is a serious Denial of Service vulnerability.</h4>

  <strong>Why this?</strong></br>
  Because every vulnerability needs a name, website and logo.

  </br>
  </br>
  <strong>Why is the logo an omellete?</strong></br>
  AWSome = AWS Omellete, gedit?
